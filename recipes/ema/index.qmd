## Overview

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) involves collecting data from participants multiple times throughout their daily lives. REDCap offers several approaches to implement EMA, each with different trade-offs in complexity, flexibility, and maintenance.

This is also known as Experience Sampling or Experience Sampling Methods, or ES / ESM. In this book, we're sticking to EMA.

This guide will help you choose the right approach for your study.

## Choosing an Approach

### Decision Guide

#### [Fixed Schedule](fixed_schedule/)

- Sample times are the same for all participants
- Schedule doesn't need to adapt based on participant responses
- You want the simplest possible implementation

#### [Random Schedule (Automatic)](random_automatic/)

- You need random/semi-random sampling within defined windows
- The schedule can be fully determined up-front
- You can set up as many events and Automated Survey Invitations (ASIs) as you will have samples
- You want everything managed within REDCap (no external tools needed to compute schedules)

#### [Random Schedule (Flexible)](random_flexible/)

- You need random sampling but want flexibility to adjust schedules
- You want to more tightly control sampling constraints (minimum spacing, etc.)
- You can use an external tool or script (R, Python, or spreadsheets) to generate schedules
- You can use the Data Import Tool or API
- You don't need REDCap's built-in survey reminder/expiration features

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Fixed | Random (Automatic) | Random (Flexible) |
|---------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Setup complexity | Low | High | Medium |
| Requires external tools | No | Yes (event / ASI mapping) | Yes (schedule generation) |
| Can adjust schedules after start | Limited | No | Yes |
| Supports custom spacing rules | No | Limited | Yes |
| Supports survey reminders | Yes | Yes | Manual implementation |
| Supports survey expiration | Yes | Yes | Manual implementation |
