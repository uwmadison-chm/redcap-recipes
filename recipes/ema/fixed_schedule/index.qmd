## Overview

**Problem:** You need to collect EMA data from participants at predetermined times (e.g., 9 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM daily for two weeks).

**Solution:** Use REDCap events and Automated Survey Invitations (ASIs) to send surveys at specific times.

## Prerequisites

* A longitudinal REDCap project
* An email field for participants
* **Project Setup and Design** rights
* **Alerts & Notifications** rights

## When to Use This Approach

Fixed schedules work well when:

- All participants receive surveys at the same times
- The schedule is predictable and consistent
- You want minimal setup complexity
- Participants knowing the schedule isn't a concern

See the [EMA overview](../) for other approaches.

## Steps

<!-- TODO: Add detailed implementation steps -->

### 1. Set Up Events

### 2. Create Your EMA Survey

### 3. Configure Automated Survey Invitations

### 4. Test the Schedule

## Complete Example

<!-- TODO: Add example with CSV files or screenshots -->

## Notes and Tips

* Fixed schedules are the simplest EMA implementation in REDCap
* Consider time zones if your study spans multiple regions
* You can use the "Ensure logic is still true" option to prevent surveys from sending if conditions change

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Surveys aren't sending at expected times

**Solution:** Check that your ASI conditions are met and that the designated email field has valid addresses
