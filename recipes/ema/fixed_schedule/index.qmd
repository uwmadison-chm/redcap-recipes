## Overview

**Problem:** You need to collect EMA data from participants at predetermined times — for example, a daily diary every morning at 9AM.

**Solution:** Use a repeating instrument with an Automated Survey Invitation (ASI)

## Prerequisites

* An email field for participants
* **Project Setup and Design** rights
* **Alerts & Notifications** rights

## When to Use This Approach

Fixed schedules work well when:

- All participants receive surveys at the same times
- The schedule is predictable and consistent
- You want minimal setup complexity
- Participants knowing the schedule isn't a concern

See the [EMA overview](../) for other approaches.

## Steps

### Create the Welcome survey

1. Create a new instrument called `welcome`
1. Add an email field to capture the participant's email address:
    * Field Type: Text Box
    * Validation: Email
    * Variable Name: `email`
1. Enable the instrument as a survey in **Designer** > **Enable** (click the instrument options icon)
1. In **Project Setup** > **Designate an email field for communications**, select `email`

### Create the Diary instrument

1. Create a new instrument called `diary`
1. Add your data collection fields.
1. Enable the instrument as a survey; set its **Survey settings** how you want them

### Set up the Diary as a Repeating Instrument

1. Go to **Project Setup** >  **Repeating instruments**
1. Click **Enable**
1. Configure the repeating instruments:
    * Check the box next to `diary`

### Create the ASI

1. Go to **Designer** and click **Survey Settings** for the `diary` instrument
1. Enable **Automated Invitations**
1. Set the **Conditions** so the logic is appropriate for your study. In the example, set it to when the `welcome` survey is completed.
1. Set **When to send...** as you want them. If you're testing, you might want **Send immediately**. For a daily diary you might want 9 AM.
1. Set **How many times to send it** as you want. For testing, you might set this to send a few times, every 5 minutes. For a real diary, you might have it send once a day for 30 days.

## Notes

* **Timing precision:** How often REDCap sends scheduled messages depends on your instance's server settings. Our server sends scheduled messages every 5 minutes. **Send immediately** alerts are generally not subject to this delay.
* **First survey timing:** The first diary invitation will be sent on the next scheduled time after the welcome survey is completed. If a participant completes the welcome survey at 2 PM and you've scheduled surveys for 9 AM, they'll receive their first diary survey the next morning at 9 AM.
* **New instance behavior:** Each survey invitation creates a new repeating instance of the `diary` instrument. You don't need to manually create instances with `[new-instance]`
* **Time zones:** REDCap uses the server's time zone for all automated invitations. Taking time zones into account is a subject for another recipe.
* **Stopping the invitations:** To stop surveys for participants who withdraw, see [Stopping Alerts and ASIs](../../stopping_alerts_asis/)
* **Survey expiration:** Setting an expiration (e.g., 24 hours) can help keep data collection timely, but consider your participants' schedules and availability
* **Other contact methods:** The exact same practices apply if you're using an SMS provider such as Twilio or Mosio.

Remember the server schedule delay when you are troubleshooting!

## Troubleshooting

* Verify the ASI is active and saved
* Confirm the condition logic evaluates to true for the records you expect
* Check that the email field is really the designated email field
* Check **Survey Distribution Tools** > **Survey Invitation Log** to see scheduled and sent invitations

During the time between when a survey is scheduled and when it is sent, it will not appear in the **Survey Invitation Log** at all.
