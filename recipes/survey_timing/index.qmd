## Overview

**Problem:** Survey timing data—when a participant started, finished, and how long they took—is valuable for data quality checks (e.g., detecting bots or speeders) and analysis, but these values are only available in smart variables (`[survey-time-started]`, `[survey-time-completed]`, `[survey-duration-completed]`) that don't appear in data exports.

**Solution:** Use `@CALCTEXT` fields to capture survey timing smart variables into regular fields that export with your data.

## Approaches

There are two ways to implement this:

1. **Add timing fields to each survey:** Fields go at the end of the instrument they track
1. **Create a single timing form:** One instrument contains timing fields for all surveys

This recipe recommends the single timing form because:

- It doesn't clutter your surveys with metadata fields
- You can't add fields to PROMIS or other auto-scored/adaptive surveys, so you'd need both approaches anyway
- Participants can't accidentally see these fields if they return to a survey

The downside is that having calculations run from a different instrument can feel mysterious.

## Steps

### Create the timing fields

For each survey you want to track, create three fields. In this example, the survey is named `daily_diary`:

- `daily_diary_started_at`:
    - Field Type: Text Box
    - Validation: Datetime (Y-M-D H:M:S)
    - Action Tags: `@CALCTEXT([survey-time-started:daily_diary:value])`
- `daily_diary_completed_at`:
    - Field Type: Text Box
    - Validation: Datetime (Y-M-D H:M:S)
    - Action Tags: `@CALCTEXT([survey-time-completed:daily_diary:value])`
- `daily_diary_duration`:
    - Field Type: Text Box
    - Validation: Integer
    - Action Tags: `@CALCTEXT([survey-duration-completed:daily_diary])`

::: {.callout-tip title="Duration is in seconds"}
The `[survey-duration-completed]` smart variable returns the duration in seconds. If you want a different unit, you can append `:{unit}` where `unit` is `y` `M` `d` `h` `m` or `s`.

### If using a separate timing form

If you're putting timing fields on a separate form:

- Create a form (e.g., `survey_timing`) to hold all your timing fields
- Go to **Project Setup** > **Designate Instruments for My Events**
- Add your timing form to every event that contains surveys you want to track

### For repeating surveys

If you have repeating surveys (using **Repeat Entire Event** or **Repeat Instrument**):

- If using **Repeat Entire Event**, put the timing fields on a form in the same event
- If using **Repeat Instrument**, you must put the timing fields on the survey itself—a separate form won't have matching instances

## Notes

- **Surveys only:** These calculations only run when data is saved through the survey interface. If staff complete the instrument through the data entry form, the timing fields will remain blank.
- **When calculations run:** The `@CALCTEXT` calculations execute _when survey data is saved,_ which captures the timing values into your regular data fields. You do not need to save the timing form for the values to update.
- **Form renaming:** If you rename a survey, remember to update both the field names and the `@CALCTEXT` calculations.
- **Performance:** Unlike using smart variables directly in reports or dashboards (which incurs a performance penalty because timing data is stored separately), these exported fields perform normally in all REDCap features.

## Troubleshooting

### Timing fields are blank

- Verify the instrument was completed as a survey, not through the data entry form
- Check that the form name in the smart variable matches the actual form name exactly
- Ensure the timing form is designated for the correct event
