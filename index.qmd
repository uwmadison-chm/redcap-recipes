## Welcome

Welcome to REDCap Recipes, a collection of practical guides and solutions for working with [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) (Research Electronic Data Capture).

REDCap is a web application and database, mainly for running for research studies. It is extremely powerful. It is _not,_ however, simple to use and understand; study builders will find many similar-looking paths to do what they need to achieve goals. Those paths may ultimately lead to surprise pitfalls. This guide aims to give you a set of maps to let you avoid the worst time sinks.

## What you'll find here

This site contains **recipes** — focused, practical guides that address specific REDCap challenges. Each recipe presents a problem and offers steps to solve it. In some cases, recipes may contain XML files with example study implementations.

::: aside
This guide is _not,_ however, a general guide to running studies in REDCap.

You should expect to adapt these recipes to your own studies. Your field names will likely not match the ones in the recipes, and that's okay.

## About 

This guide was developed using a REDCap system at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, hosted by the School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH). The authors are neither REDCap admins nor members of the REDCap consortium; our knowledge of REDCap's inner workings and implementation is limited to what is publicly available, with help and advice from the excellent SMPH crew.

At the time of writing, the REDCap system we are using is version 16.0.6. It is mainly a stock installation; few (if any) recipes will rely on external modules. No guides will require admin rights on your REDCap system.

You will need to have **Project Setup and Design** rights to your project. Some recipes will require other rights (**Alerts & Notifications**, **Data Import**, and so on.) We'll assume you already have necessary rights. Some recipes will only be practical for some studies through the use of the API, though the Data Import Tool will almost always be an alternative.

This guide was written by Nate Vack and Stuti Shrivistava at the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
